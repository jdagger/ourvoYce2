            ourvoYce is interested in statistical data. Don't worry, we won't get too wonky, 
            so here's an example: Ask ten people whether they prefer the taste of Coke over Pepsi 
            and you'll get some interesting feedback. Maybe even an argument. Now, ask ten THOUSAND 
            people to answer that same question, and you'll start to see a trends.
